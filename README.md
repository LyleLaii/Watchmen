# WatchMen

**A Kubernetes scheduler plugin that uses Promethean metrics to control container scheduling.**

*This is just a practice project, and hope it can give you some inspiration*

Build this demo just use memory metrics too test it.

Use simple linear regression to predict future metrics.

Based on kubernetes scheduling framework @1.18.10

Practice Plan:

- More kinds of metric

- AI Algorithm

- More refined control processes
